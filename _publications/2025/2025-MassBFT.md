  In this work, we present MassBFT, a Byzantine fault-tolerant geoconsensus protocol that achieves high performance and scalability. We design an encoded bijective log replication to eliminate the leader bottleneck and reduce the cross-datacenter network consumption. We also propose asynchronous log ordering to eliminate synchronization across groups.
