  In this work, we first establish a correlation between vertex processing order and the number of iterations, providing an opportunity to reduce the number of iterations. We propose a metric function to evaluate the effectiveness of vertex processing order in accelerating iterative computations. Leveraging this metric, we propose a novel graph reordering method, GoGraph, which constructs an efficient vertex processing order. Additionally, for evolving graphs, we further propose a metric function designed to evaluate the effectiveness of vertex processing orders in response to graph changes and provide three optional methods for dynamically adjusting the vertex processing order.
