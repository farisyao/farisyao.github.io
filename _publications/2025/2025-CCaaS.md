abstract: >-
  Existing disaggregated databases simply couple CC either with the execution layer or the storage layer, which limits the performance and elasticity of these systems. This paper proposes Concurrency Control as a Service (CCaaS), which decouples CC from databases, building an execution-CC-storage three-layer decoupled database, allowing independent scaling and upgrades for improved elasticity, resource utilization, and development agility.
