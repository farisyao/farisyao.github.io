  In this paper, we propose RAGraph, a Region-Aware framework for geo-distributed graph processing. At the core of RAGraph, we design a region-aware graph processing framework that allows advancing inefficient global updates locally and enables sensible coordination-free message interactions. RAGraph also contains an adaptive hierarchical message interaction engine to switch interaction modes adaptively based on network heterogeneity and fluctuation, and a discrepancy-aware message filtering strategy to filter important messages.
