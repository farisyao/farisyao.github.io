abstract: >-
In this paper, we propose GETL, a generalized graph ETL framework capable of automatically identifying graph model schemas and performing seamless data conversion among RDF, RDF-star, labeled property graph, and the relational model. This is attributed to GETL’s unified graph representation model, constructed as nested <label, entity> pairs, offering powerful capabilities in graph representation and model compatibility. Additionally, we develop a unified programming interface to support complex graph transformation tasks. It is built upon the Gremlin syntax and provides strong expressive capabilities. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that GETL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of model conversion efficiency and data manipulation language (DML) intelligibility.
